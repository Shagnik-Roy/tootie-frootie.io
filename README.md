# tootie-frootie.io

This is a silly website I made for my anniversary with my girlfriend. Not good at using my hands and I know how to code. Therefore, I made this.

The link if you want to check it out: https://shagnik-roy.github.io/tootie-frootie.io/
Fork the repository and make changes to the customize script, to make changes to images and all text content.

This was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (in which I used GSAP for the animation)
